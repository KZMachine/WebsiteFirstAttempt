            Just in case you missed it on the home page or you have not taken a look underneath my lovely self-portrait
            over to the left, my name is Karim Zaher and I am a Computer Engineering honors student at <button onclick="openUniversitySite()" style="border-radius:30%; border: none; outline:none;">Texas A&M</button> University.
            In my freetime, I like to hang out with my friends or learn about new topics that I find interesting. Most recently,
            for example, I have begun learning about Robot Operating System, a software framework used in robotics.

            Growing up, I always had an interest in robots and computers. On my 7th birthday, I got a little robot
            friend named RoboSapien, or Rob for short. Although Rob was not the sole reason I felt compelled to
            go into the field of <button onclick="openCompEngr()" style="border-radius:30%; border: none; outline:none;">
            Computer Engineering</button>, I believe that he was the first stepping stone in my journey
            to becoming who I am today. Growing up in a household with a passionate Computer Scientist -- my dad -- also
            contributed towards the discovery of my 2 passions: computers and problem-solving. Although my interests in
            Artificial Intelligence and Robotics shine bright, I find all fields of Computer Science and Engineering interesting
            and would be open to working in any field that catches my attention. In fact, throughout my life, I have explored
            hundreds of career options ranging from everyone’s childhood dream of becoming an astronaut to the more complex
            concept of quantum computing. All of these dreams, however, involved computers in one way or another.That is why I
            decided to venture into the realm of computers and their inner-workings.

            When I've got plenty of freetime, I like taking in what nature has to offer. And when I am in awe, I like  to pull my
            phone out and snap a picture or two of the scenery in front of me. As such, I have inevitably become somewhat of a
            <button onclick="openPictureDrive()" style="border-radius:30%; border:none; outline:none;">photographer</button>. Whether it be a lushious grotto in the United Kingdom, a lovely sunset, the blue sky, or my personal
            favorite 'squirrel grumpily eats bread that was meant for the ducks', I will never miss an opportunity to capture something
            that is worthwhile. In any case, there is truly not a dull moment when it comes to going out and exploring the world.
            And at the end of the day, having a great understanding of this world is what it means to be a problem-solver.
